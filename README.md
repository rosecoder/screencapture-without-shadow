# Screencapture without shadow

A simple macOS app that captures window screenshots without shadows.

IMPORTANT: This is a quick hack, made with 2 prompts in Cursor. Even this README (except this sentance) is prompted. A friend requested it so I made it.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rosecoder/screencapture-without-shadow
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

   ```
   open "Screencapture without shadow.xcodeproj"
   ```

3. Run the app by clicking the Play button or pressing âŒ˜+R

4. When prompted, grant the app accessibility permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility

5. To capture a screenshot:
   - Select a window from the list
   - The screenshot will be saved to your Desktop without shadows
